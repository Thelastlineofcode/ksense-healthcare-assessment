Healthcare API Assessment
1. Assessment Context
API: DemoMed Healthcare API (a fictional system for coding evaluation)

Your Role: Demonstrate API integration and data processing skills.

Goal: Show how you handle real-world API challenges and data inconsistencies.

NOTE: This is simulated test data created specifically for assessment purposes only.

2. Your API Key
A unique API key has been automatically generated for this session. You will need this key to authenticate with the API endpoints.

Your API Key
ak_a9b6d927e2b39f000255b874c64692ab92bd1bec3bacc40a

Authentication
All API requests require authentication using the x-api-key header:

Headers: { "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
3. API Information
Base URL: https://assessment.ksensetech.com/api

API Behavior (Important!)
This API simulates real-world conditions:

Rate limiting: May return 429 errors if you make requests too quickly.
Intermittent failures: ~8% chance of 500/503 errors (requires retry logic).
Pagination: Returns 5 patients per page by default (~10 pages, ~50 patients total).
Inconsistent responses: Occasionally returns data in different formats or with missing fields.

4. Your Task: Implement Risk Scoring
Create a patient risk scoring system. The total risk is the sum of scores from each category.

Blood Pressure Risk
Note: If systolic and diastolic readings fall into different risk categories, use the higher risk stage for scoring.

Normal (Systolic <120 AND Diastolic <80): 1 points
Elevated (Systolic 120‑129 AND Diastolic <80): 2 points
Stage 1 (Systolic 130‑139 OR Diastolic 80‑89): 3 points
Stage 2 (Systolic ≥140 OR Diastolic ≥90): 4 points
Invalid/Missing Data (0 points):
• Missing systolic or diastolic values (e.g., "150/" or "/90")
• Non-numeric values (e.g., "INVALID", "N/A")
• Null, undefined, or empty values
Temperature Risk
Normal (≤99.5°F): 0 points
Low Fever (99.6-100.9°F): 1 point
High Fever (≥‮0.101‬°F): 2 points
Invalid/Missing Data (0 points):
• Non-numeric values (e.g., "TEMP_ERROR", "invalid")
• Null, undefined, or empty values
Age Risk
Under 40 (<40 years): 1 points
40-65 (40-65 years, inclusive): 1 point
Over 65 (>65 years): 2 points
Invalid/Missing Data (0 points):
• Null, undefined, or empty values
• Non-numeric strings (e.g., "fifty-three", "unknown")
Total Risk Score = (BP Score) + (Temp Score) + (Age Score)

5. Required Outputs
Your solution should be able to produce these outputs based on your data analysis.

Alert Lists: Your system should identify patients who meet specific criteria:
High-Risk Patients: Patient IDs with total risk score ≥ 4
Fever Patients: Patient IDs with temperature ≥ 99.6°F
Data Quality Issues: Patient IDs with invalid/missing data (e.g., BP, Age, or Temp is missing/malformed)
6. Deliverables & Submission
You must submit your results by making a POST request to the assessment API.

📝 Submission Attempts
You have 3 attempts to submit your assessment. Each submission provides immediate feedback to help you improve your score.
